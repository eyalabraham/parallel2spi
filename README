ATmega328p AVR used as parallel<-->serial SPI to interface the FlashLite v25 CPU board with Ethernet, LCD and/or SD Card (built into LCD).
The Flashlite-V25 is a single board computer based on the NEC V-25 Plus micro-controller.
The V-25 is a 16-bit, single-chip micro-controller that is software compatible with the Intel 8086/8088 family of microprocessors.
It comes with embedded DOS and utility software on the on-board flash disk.
This is a very simple implementation with no interrupt handling, per byte read and write operation only.
AVR is used as a smart hand-shake capable shift register, with the interrupt handling done by the v25 CPU.
The v25 uses a 82C55 PIO with PortA in Mode-2, with automatic hand shake signal generation and interrupt line to v25.
